SUBLIME TEXT EDITOR:

   Sublime Text is a cross-platform source code editor with a Python application programming interface (API). It natively supports many programming languages and markup languages, and its functionality can be extended by users with plugins, typically community-built and maintained under free-software licenses.

  #Interface:

         The interface of Sublime Text 2
        
         # Themes:

                 Sublime Text contains 22 different visual themes, with the option to download additional themes and configure custom themes via third-party plugins.The minimap feature shows a reduced overview of the entire file in the top-right corner of the screen. The portion of the file visible in the main editor pane is highlighted and clicking or dragging in this view scrolls the editor through the file.[5]
          
	 # Panels, groups and screen modes:

                 The program offers a number of screen modes including panels that can show up to four files at once as well as full screen and distraction free modes which only show one file without any of the additional menus around it.

   #Features:

		Sublime Text has a number of features in addition to these including,

		    1.Auto-save, which attempts to prevents users from losing their work
                    2.Customizable key bindings, a navigational tool which allows users to assign hotkeys to their choice of options in both the menus and the toolbar.
                    3.Find as you type, begins to look for the text being entered as the user types without requiring a separate dialog box.
                    4.Spell check function corrects as you type.
                    5.Macros.
                    6.Repeat the last action.
                    7.A wide selection of editing commands, including indenting and unindenting, paragraph reformatting and line joining.

  #Shortcuts:

    Use Goto Anything to open files with only a few keystrokes, and instantly jump to symbols, lines or words.Triggered with Ctrl+P, it is possible to:

            1.Type part of a file name to open it.
            2.Type @ to jump to symbols
            3.# to search within the file, and : to go to a line number.

   #Benefits:

      1. Command Palette

           The Command Palette holds infrequently used functionality, like sorting, changing the syntax and changing the indentation settings. With just a few keystrokes, you can search for what you want, without ever having to navigate through the menus or remember obscure key bindings.Show the Command Palette with Ctrl+Shift+P.

      2.Split Editing

           Get the most out of your wide screen monitor with split editing support. Edit files side by side, or edit two locations in the one file. You can edit with as many rows and columns as you wish.

      3.Customize Anything

           Key Bindings, Menus, Snippets, Macros, Completions and more - just about everything in Sublime Text is customizable with simple JSON files. 

      4.Multiple Selections

           Make ten changes at the same time, not one change ten times. Multiple selections allow you to interactively change many lines at once, rename variables with ease, and manipulate files faster than ever.Try pressing Ctrl+Shift+L to split the selection into lines and Ctrl+D to select the next occurrence of the selected word. 

      5.Distraction Free Mode

           Distraction Free Mode is full screen, chrome free editing, with nothing but your text in the center of the screen. You can incrementally show elements of the UI, such as tabs and the find panel, as you need them.

      6.Instant Project Switch

           Projects in Sublime Text capture the full contents of the workspace, including modified and unsaved files. You can switch between projects in a manner similar to Goto Anything, and the switch is instant, with no save prompts - all your modifications will be restored next time the project is opened.

      7.Plugin API

           Sublime Text has a powerful, Python based plugin API. Along with the API, it comes with a built in Python console to interactively experiment in real time.

      8.Cross Platform

          Sublime Text is available for OS X, Windows and Linux. One license is all you need to use Sublime Text on every computer you own, no matter what operating system it uses.
